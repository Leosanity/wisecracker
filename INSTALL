WISECRACKER INSTALLATION
======================

Pre-requisites:

1. CMake: You need to have cmake 2.6 or above installed.
2. Compilers: gcc is needed along with standard headers.
3. GNU Make: make is needed to build the code for Linux and Mac OSX.
4. OpenCL: You will need to install OpenCL SDK from Intel, NVIDIA, and/or
AMD. If you're on Mac OS X you can just use Apple's OpenCL framework.
5. For Windows you will need Visual Studio C++ 64-bit. Any version from 2005
onwards is supported.
6. For Windows you will also need OpenSSL-Win64 from
http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
7. For Windows you will also need the executable xxd.exe which can be gotten by
installing either Vim or GNU utilities using MSys or Mingw or Cygwin.
8. If you're running this on an Amazon AWS EC2 GPU VM, then you can setup your
VM using the setup_amazonaws.sh script in the scripts/ directory

How to install:

Release build:

For Linux:

$ export OPENCL_ROOT=/path/to/OpenCL/SDK
$ make release
$ make test
$ make install

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/install

For Mac OSX
$ make release
$ make test
$ make install

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/install

For Windows 64-bit
$ set OPENCL_ROOT=/path/to/OpenCL/installation
$ set OPENSSL_ROOT=/path/to/OpenSSL-Win64/installation
$ set XXD=/path/to/xxd.exe
$ build_nmake.bat
$ build_nmake.bat test
$ build_nmake.bat install

By default the installation on Windows will be done in a directory called
"wisecracker" which can then be packaged up for distribution if needed.

The code is only tested on a 64-bit system. We do not support 32-bit systems.
