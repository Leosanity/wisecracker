WISECRACKER INSTALLATION
======================

Pre-requisites:

1. CMake: You need to have cmake 2.6 or above installed.
2. Compilers: gcc is needed along with standard headers.
3. GNU Make: make is needed to build the code.
4. OpenCL: You will need to install OpenCL SDK from Intel, NVIDIA, and/or
AMD. If you're on Mac OS X you can just use Apple's OpenCL framework.

How to install:

Release build:

Optionally export OPENCL_ROOT on the Mac, otherwise it is necessary on Linux.
$ export OPENCL_ROOT=/path/to/OpenCL/SDK
$ make release
$ make test
$ make install

Debug build:

Optionally export OPENCL_ROOT on the Mac, otherwise it is necessary on Linux.
$ export OPENCL_ROOT=/path/to/OpenCL/SDK
$ make

By default make will try to install in /usr/local. If you want your custom
directory then you can do the following:

$ make install PREFIX=/path/to/install

The code is only tested on a 64-bit system. We do not support 32-bit systems yet
although you can try your luck.
If you're on a 64-bit system and want to compile for 32-bit, you can do the
following:

$ make ARCH=i386
$ make test ARCH=i386
$ make install ARCH=i386
